<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Subash, a second-year IT student with a strong passion 
  for technology, creativity, and self-improvement. My academic 
  journey revolves around mastering UI/UX design, web development, 
  and data structures, as I aim to gain in-depth knowledge about how 
  computers work and coding processes. Alongside my studies, I 
  dedicate myself to learning new skills, such as Python programming 
  and Spanish, with the goal of becoming a multilingual professional. 
  I thrive on challenges and seek to excel in everything I pursue.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I am deeply invested in personal growth and 
  discipline. Fitness is a cornerstone of my routine, as I believe it 
  transforms both body and mind. My interests extend to music 
  production, where I explore tools like FL Studio Mobile and Ableton 
  to cultivate my passion for creating melodies. I also take a
   strategic approach to earning through stock trading, reflecting 
   my aspirations to become financially independent and achieve
    success in business.</p>

<p>Driven by ambition, I envision a future where I excel as a designer,
   musician, and entrepreneur. My diverse pursuits are tied together by
    my commitment to continuous learning and self-discipline. Whether 
    it's preparing for the DELE Spanish exams, planning innovative 
    projects like heart disease prediction, or striving to emulate 
    the intelligence of characters like the Professor from Money Heist,
     I am determined to leave a lasting impact in all my endeavors.</p>
